Also known as the subclass of of QMA with classical witnesses.

No classical oracle separation between QCMA and <a href="ComplexityZoo_Q_qma.html">QMA</a> is currently known.</p><p>The problem GROUND STATE CONNECTIVITY, which intuitively asks whether a local Hamiltonian's ground space has an "energy barrier", is QCMA-complete <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#gs15" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[GS15]</a>. Roughly: Given a local Hamiltonian H and ground states v and w, is there a polynomial-length sequence of local unitary operations mapping v to w, such that each intermediate state encountered remains in the ground space of H?</p><h3>Linked From 1 Classes</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="QMA:_Quantum_MA"><span id="qma" style="color:red">QMA</span>: Quantum <a href="ComplexityZoo_M_ma.html" title="Complexity Zoo:M">MA</a></span></h5><p>The class of decision problems such that a "yes" answer can be verified by a 1-message quantum interactive proof.

Combining that result with <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#ver92" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Ver92]</a>, one can obtain an oracle relative to which <a href="ComplexityZoo_A_am.html" title="Complexity Zoo:A">AM</a> is not in QMA.</p><p>Kitaev (<a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#ksv02" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[KSV02]</a>, see also <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#an02" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[AN02]</a>) showed that the <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Garden#k-local-ham" title="Complexity Garden">5-Local Hamiltonians</a> Problem is QMA-complete. Subsequently, Kempe and Regev <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#kr03" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[KR03]</a> showed that even 3-Local Hamiltonians is QMA-complete.
