A problem L is in NT* if, first, there is a partially defined predecessor function pred(x) in <a href="ComplexityZoo_F_fp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:F">FP</a> that organizes the space of inputs into a forest.  The size of the lineage of each x must also be bounded by 2<sup>poly(|x|)</sup>.  Second, if L(x) is the Boolean answer to L on input x, then L(x)+L(pred(x)) is computable in polynomial time; or if pred(x) does not exist, L(x) is computable in polynomial time.</p><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#ghj91" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[GHJ+91]</a>.</p><p>Contains <a href="ComplexityZoo_N_nt.html">NT</a> and is contained in <a href="ComplexityZoo_Symbols_parityp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:Symbols">&#8853;P</a>.  The inclusions are either both strict or both equalities (whence <a href="ComplexityZoo_Symbols_parityp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:Symbols">&#8853;P</a> = <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_p.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">P</a> as well).</p><h3>Linked From</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="NT:_Near-Testable"><span id="nt" style="color:red">NT</span>: Near-Testable</span></h5><p>The class of decision problems such that whether the answer on input x agrees with the answer on input x-1 (that is, the lexicographic predecessor of x) is solvable in polynomial time.  The Turing machine has to decide agreement or disagreement without access to the answer for x-1.</p><p>Is contained in <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_e.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">E</a>, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="ComplexityZoo_N_ntstar.html">NT*</a></span>, and <a href="ComplexityZoo_Symbols_parityp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:Symbols">&#8853;P</a>.
