Here the verifier is a <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BQP</a> (i.e. quantum polynomial-time) algorithm, while the prover has unbounded computational resources (though cannot violate the linearity of quantum mechanics). The prover and verifier exchange a polynomial number of messages, which can be quantum states.  Thus, the verifier's and prover's states may become entangled during the course of the protocol.  Given the verifier's algorithm, we require that</p><ol><li>If the answer is "yes," then the prover can behave in such a way that the verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3.</li><li>If the answer is "no," then however the prover behaves, the verifier rejects with probability at least 2/3.</li></ol><p>Let QIP[k] be QIP where the prover and verifier are restricted to exchanging k messages (with the prover going last).</p><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#wat99" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Wat99]</a>, where it was also shown that <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PSPACE</a> is in QIP[3].</p><p>Subsequently <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#kw00" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[KW00]</a> showed that for all k&gt;3, QIP[k] = QIP[3] = QIP.</p><p>QIP is contained in <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_exp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EXP</a> <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#kw00" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[KW00]</a>.</p><p>QIP = IP = PSPACE <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#JJUW09" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[JJUW09]</a>; thus quantum computing adds no power to single-prover interactive proofs.</p><p>QIP(1) is more commonly known as <a href="ComplexityZoo_Q_qma.html">QMA</a>.</p><p>See also: <a href="ComplexityZoo_Q_qip2.html">QIP[2]</a>, <a href="ComplexityZoo_Q_qszk.html">QSZK</a>.</p><h3>Linked From</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="ALL:_The_Class_of_All_Languages"><span id="all" style="color:red">ALL</span>: The Class of All Languages</span></h5><p>Literally, the class of ALL languages.</p><p>ALL is a gargantuan beast that's been wreaking havoc in the Zoo of late.</p><p>First <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#aar04b" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Aar04b]</a> observed that <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PP</a>/rpoly (<a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PP</a> with polynomial-size randomized advice) equals ALL, as does <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_postbqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PostBQP</a>/qpoly (<a href="ComplexityZoo_P_postbqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PostBQP</a> with polynomial-size quantum advice).</p><p>Then <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#raz05" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Raz05]</a> showed that <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="ComplexityZoo_Q_qip.html" title="Complexity Zoo:Q">QIP</a></span>/qpoly, and even <a href="ComplexityZoo_I_ip.html" title="Complexity Zoo:I">IP</a>(2)/rpoly, equal ALL.</p><p>Nor is it hard to show that <a href="ComplexityZoo_M_maexp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:M">MA<sub>EXP</sub></a>/rpoly = ALL.</p><p>Also, per <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#aar18" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Aar18]</a>, <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pdqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PDQP</a>/qpoly = ALL.</p><p>On the other hand, even though <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PSPACE</a> contains <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PP</a>, and <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_expspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EXPSPACE</a> contains <a href="ComplexityZoo_A_maexp.html">MA<sub>EXP</sub></a>, it's easy to see that <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PSPACE</a>/rpoly = <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_pspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PSPACE</a>/poly and <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_expspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EXPSPACE</a>/rpoly = <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_expspace.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EXPSPACE</a>/poly are not ALL.</p><p>So does ALL have no respect for complexity class inclusions at ALL?  (Sorry.)</p><p>It is not as contradictory as it first seems.  The deterministic base class in all of these examples is modified by computational non-determinism <i>after</i> it is modified by advice.  For example, <a href="ComplexityZoo_M_maexp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:M">MA<sub>EXP</sub></a>/rpoly means M(A<sub>EXP</sub>/rpoly), while (<a href="ComplexityZoo_M_maexp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:M">MA<sub>EXP</sub></a>)/rpoly equals <a href="ComplexityZoo_M_maexp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:M">MA<sub>EXP</sub></a>/poly by a standard argument.  In other words, it's only the verifier, not the prover or post-selector, who receives the randomized or quantum advice. The prover knows a description of the advice state, but not its measured values.  Modification by /rpoly does preserve class inclusions when it is applied after other changes.</p><p><i><a href="ComplexityZoo_A_all.html">More about...</a></i></p><hr/><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="IP:_Interactive_Proof_Systems"><span id="ip" style="color:red">IP</span>: Interactive Proof Systems</span></h5><p>The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by an <i>interactive proof</i>.  Here a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier sends messages back and forth with an all-powerful prover.  They can have polynomially many rounds of interaction. Given the verifier's algorithm, at the end:</p><ol><li>If the answer is "yes," the prover must be able to behave in such a way that the verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3 (over the choice of the verifier's random bits).</li><li>If the answer is "no," then however the prover behaves the verifier must reject with probability at least 2/3.</li></ol><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#gmr89" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[GMR89]</a>, with the motivation of providing a framework for the introduction of zero-knowledge proofs (see the class <a href="ComplexityZoo_Z_zk.html" title="Complexity Zoo:Z">ZK</a>). Interestingly, the power of general interactive proof systems is not decreased if the verifier is only allowed random queries (i.e., it merely tosses coins and sends any outcome to the prover). The latter model, known as the Arthur-Merlin (or public-coin) model was introduced independently (but later) in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#babai85" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Bab85]</a>, and a strong equivalent (which preserves the number of rounds) is proved in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#gs86" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[GS86]</a>. Often, it is required that the prover can convince the verifier to accept correct assertions with probability 1; this is called <i>perfect completeness</i>.However, the definitions with one-sided and two-sided error can be shown to be equivalent (see <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#fgmsz89" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[FGM+89]</a>).</p><p>First demonstration to the power of interactive proofs was given by showing that for <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Garden#graph_isomorphism" title="Complexity Garden"><i>graph nonisomorphism</i></a> (a problem not known in <a href="ComplexityZoo_N_np.html" title="Complexity Zoo:N">NP</a>) has such proofs <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#gmw91" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[GMW91]</a>.
