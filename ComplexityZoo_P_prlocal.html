Each vertex starts with the state of knowing only its ID and has unbounded, deterministic, computational ability. At each round, every vertex synchronously sends and receives one unbounded message from each neighbor. At the end of the algorithm, each vertex gives an output satisfying the problem. For instance, the vertices may output a valid <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Garden#coloring" title="Complexity Garden">coloring</a>.</p><p>Proven in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#RG20" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[RG20]</a> that P-LOCAL = <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="ComplexityZoo_P_prlocal.html">P-RLOCAL</a></span>.</p><p><i><a href="ComplexityZoo_P_plocal.html">More about...</a></i></p><hr/></body>
