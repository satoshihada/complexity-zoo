<body><h3>Class Description</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="EQPK:_Exact_Quantum_Polynomial-Time_with_Gate_Set_K"><span id="eqpk" style="color:red">EQP<sub>K</sub></span>: Exact Quantum Polynomial-Time with Gate Set K</span></h5><p>The set of problems that can be answered by a uniform family of polynomial-sized quantum circuits whose gates are drawn from a set K, and that return the correct answer with probability 1, and run in polynomial time with probability 1, and the allowed gates are drawn from a set K.  K may be either finite or countable and enumerated.  If S is a ring, the union of EQP<sub>K</sub> over all finite gate sets K whose amplitudes are in the ring R can be written EQP<sub>S</sub>.</p><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#adh97" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[ADH97]</a> in the special case of a finite set of 1-qubit gates controlled by a second qubit.  It was shown there that transcendental gates may be replaced by algebraic gates without decreasing the size of EQP<sub>K</sub>.</p><p><a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#fr98" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[FR98]</a> show that EQP<sub>Q</sub> is in <a href="ComplexityZoo_L_lwpp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:L">LWPP</a>.  The proof can be generalized to any finite, algebraic gate set K.</p><p>The hidden shift problem for a vector space over Z/2 is in EQP<sub>Q</sub> by Simon's algorithm.  The <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Garden#discrete_logarithm" title="Complexity Garden">discrete logarithm</a> problem over Z/p is in EQP<sub>Q-bar</sub> using infinitely many gates <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#mz03" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[MZ03]</a>.</p><h3>Linked From 1 Classes</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="EQP:_Exact_Quantum_Polynomial-Time"><span id="eqp" style="color:red">EQP</span>: Exact Quantum Polynomial-Time</span></h5><p>The same as <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BQP</a>, except that the quantum algorithm must return the correct answer with probability 1, and run in polynomial time with probability 1.  Unlike bounded-error quantum computing, there is no theory of universal QTMs for exact quantum computing models.  In the original definition in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#bv97" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[BV97]</a>, each language in EQP is computed by a single QTM, equivalently to a uniform family of quantum circuits with a finite gate set K whose amplitudes can be computed in polynomial time. See <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="ComplexityZoo_E_eqpk.html">EQP<sub>K</sub></a></span>.  However, some results require an infinite gate set.  The official definition here is that the gate set should be finite.</p><p>Without loss of generality, the amplitudes in the gate set K are algebraic numbers <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#adh97" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[ADH97]</a>.</p><p>There is an oracle that separates EQP from <a href="ComplexityZoo_N_np.html" title="Complexity Zoo:N">NP</a> <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#bv97" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[BV97]</a>, indeed from <a href="ComplexityZoo_D_delta2p.html" title="Complexity Zoo:D">&#916;<sub>2</sub>P</a> <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#gp01" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[GP01]</a>.
