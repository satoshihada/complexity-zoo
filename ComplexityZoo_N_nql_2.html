<body><h3>Class Description</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="NQL:_Nondeterministic_Quantum_Languages"><span id="nql_2" style="color:red">NQL</span>: Nondeterministic Quantum Languages</span></h5><p>An unfortunate name collision. The class of problems nondeterministically recognized by <i>Kondacs-Watrous Quantum Finite Automata</i>. These are automata that undergo a unitary transformation for each symbol consumed, and are measured after <b>each</b> step to check for acceptance or rejection. The "nondeterminism" refers to the fact that the automaton will accept with positive probability if in the language, or with exactly zero probability otherwise.</p><p>Has the same caveats as <a href="ComplexityZoo_N_nqp.html">NQP</a> and <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_eqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EQP</a> because of the exact acceptance probabilities.</p><p>Initially studied in &lt;ref&gt;A.
