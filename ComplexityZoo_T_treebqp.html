Each g<sup>(t)</sup> can be either be selected from some finite universal basis of unitary gates (the choice turns out not to matter), or can be a 1-qubit measurement.  When we perform a measurement, the state evolves to one of two possible pure states, with the usual probabilities, rather than to a mixed state.  We require that the final gate g<sup>(p(n))</sup> is a measurement of the first qubit.  If at least one intermediate state was more than distance 2<sup>-&#937;(n)</sup> away from the nearest state of tree size at most p(n), then the outcome of the final measurement is chosen adversarially; otherwise it is given by the usual Born probabilities.  The measurement must return 1 with probability at least 2/3 if the input is in the language, and with probability at most 1/3 otherwise.</p><p>Contains <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bpp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BPP</a>, and is contained in <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BQP</a>.</p><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#aar03b" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Aar03b]</a>, where it was also shown that TreeBQP iscontained in the third level of <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_ph.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PH</a>, which might provide weak evidence thatTreeBQP does not equal <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BQP</a>.</p><h3>Linked From 1 Classes</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="AmpP-BQP:_BQP_Restricted_To_AmpP_States"><span id="amppbqp" style="color:red">AmpP-BQP</span>: <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BQP</a> Restricted To <a href="/Zoo_Exhibit#ampp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zoo Exhibit">AmpP</a> States</span></h5><p>Similar to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="ComplexityZoo_T_treebqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:T">TreeBQP</a></span> except that the quantum computer's state at each time step is restricted to being exponentially close to a state in <a href="/Zoo_Exhibit#ampp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zoo Exhibit">AmpP</a> (that is, a state for which the amplitudes are computable by a classical polynomial-size circuit).</p><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#aar03b" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[Aar03b]</a>, where it was also observed that AmpP-BQP is contained in the third level of <a href="ComplexityZoo_P_ph.html" title="Complexity Zoo:P">PH</a>, just as <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><a href="ComplexityZoo_T_treebqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:T">TreeBQP</a></span> is.</p><p><i><a href="ComplexityZoo_A_amppbqp.html">More about...</a></i></p><hr/></body>
