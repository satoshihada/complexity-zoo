<body><h3>Class Description</h3><h5><span class="mw-headline" id="HalfP:_RP_With_Exactly_Half_Acceptance"><span id="halfp" style="color:red">HalfP</span>: RP With Exactly Half Acceptance</span></h5><p>The class of decision problems solvable by an <a href="ComplexityZoo_N_np.html" title="Complexity Zoo:N">NP</a> machine such that</p><ol><li>If the answer is 'yes,' exactly 1/2 of computation paths accept.</li><li>If the answer is 'no,' all computation paths reject.</li></ol><p>Significantly, the number of candidate witnesses is restricted to be a power of 2.  (This is implicit if they are binary strings.)</p><p>Contained in <a href="ComplexityZoo_R_rp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:R">RP</a>, <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_ep.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EP</a>, and <a href="ComplexityZoo_M_modkp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:M">Mod<sub>k</sub>P</a> for every odd k.  Contained in <a href="ComplexityZoo_E_eqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:E">EQP</a> by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.</p><p>Defined in <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#bb92" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[BB92]</a>, where it was called C<sub>==</sub>P[half] (C<sub>==</sub>P being an alternative name for <a href="ComplexityZoo_W_wpp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:W">WPP</a>, that apparently didn't catch on or stick).  The name used here is from <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#bs00" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[BS00]</a>.  There it was shown that HalfP is contained in every similar class in which 1/2 is replaced by some other dyadic fraction.</p><h3>Linked From</h3><p>No class.</p></body>
