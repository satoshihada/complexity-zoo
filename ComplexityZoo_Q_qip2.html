Here the verifier is a <a href="ComplexityZoo_B_bqp.html" title="Complexity Zoo:B">BQP</a> (i.e. quantum polynomial-time) algorithm, while the prover has unbounded computational resources (though cannot violate the linearity of quantum mechanics). The prover and verifier exchange a polynomial number of messages, which can be quantum states.  Thus, the verifier's and prover's states may become entangled during the course of the protocol.
