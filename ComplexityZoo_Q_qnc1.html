In theory this could be QNC<sub>1</sub>, but such a class does not seem to appear in the literature (yet)!</p><p>In contrast to <a href="ComplexityZoo_N_nc1.html" title="Complexity Zoo:N">NC<sup>1</sup></a>, it is not clear how to simulate QNC<sup>1</sup> on a quantum computer in which one qubit is initialized to a pure state, and the remaining qubits are in the maximally mixed state <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#asv00" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[ASV00]</a>.</p><p>See also <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Zooref#mn02" class="mw-redirect" title="Zooref">[MN02]</a>.</p><h3>Linked From 0 Classes</h3><p>No class.</p></body>
